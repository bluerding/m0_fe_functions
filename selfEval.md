# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
- This is absilutely a weakness and an area I am working on. I have the tools and support system to figure it out, it is just taking me a little longer than I would like. I made my calendar, now I need to make myself commit to it.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
- I liked the example used earlier as a cookbook, so I'll try to vary slightly from that. A function is sort of like a coloring book. You have your book, crayons, and pictures to color in. You will use your crayons to color the pictures within the book to have a final product! 

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
- Parameters are variables within the function. The arguments give the parameters a value. We should have the same number of parameters and arguments so that every parameter has a value.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
- Probably the vocab. I think I gave a correct answer to arguments/parameters, but I am not 100% sure that I did. Sometimes other people can break things down a step further so it makes more sense to me.
